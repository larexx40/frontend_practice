Working on several projects to improve my Frontend skills

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building real projects.

**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out landing pages and make the design look as close to the design as possible.

## Tasks
1. Flyo landing page
2. Eventee
3. # Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Learned about structuring contents on the UI.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1> d-flex justify-content-center</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
